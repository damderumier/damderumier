# 👋 Hey there! I'm Dam Derumier

Junior web dev, full-time learner, and part-time bug whisperer. I’m currently training as a **Full Stack Developer** and diving deep into the magical world of **UX Design** — because beautiful code deserves beautiful interfaces, right?

## 🤓 About Me

- 🎓 Student @ 3W Academy (HTML, CSS, JS, PHP, SQL, React, Node.js)
- 🧠 Learning UX Design & IT Support on Coursera — because I like both solving bugs *and* making users smile
- 🎮 Video game geek, especially into strategy & team-based games (yes, I organize e-sport tournaments too)
- 🗺️ Past lives: social sciences, public service, and digital exploration (aka: trying everything once before committing)

## 🌱 Currently Learning

- 🖥️ React — slowly taming the JSX beast
- ☁️ Node.js — because servers also deserve attention
- 🎨 UX Research — making users feel smart, not lost
- 🧰 Debugging — a.k.a. talking to my code like it's a person ("why are you like this?!")

## 👀 Interested In

- Crafting apps that are actually useful (or just really fun)
- Collaborating on open source projects
- UX/UI design that doesn’t make users cry
- Making tech more accessible and less scary

## 💞️ Looking to Collaborate On

- Anything web (as long as there’s coffee ☕️)
- UX design feedback loops
- Projects with a sprinkle of creativity (or chaos)

## ⚡ Fun Fact

Built a **joke website** and a **Sokoban game in Java** just to see if I could. Spoiler: I could. Bonus: it still works!

## 😄 Pronouns

She/Her — but honestly, as long as you're respectful, I'm happy.
